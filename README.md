# ðŸŒ³ Sustainable Code - by BEN ABT

Sustainable applications are becoming increasingly important, because more and more energy consumption is attributable to the operations of a platform or application.

On the user side, this can be seen in the battery life of a laptop or cell phone and as a platform operator, it can be seen in the costs of compute power.

In this repository I use well-known snippets and compare them to sustainable implementations.

It's worth it!

## Energy Calculation

The energy consumption of an application itself is comparatively complex to measure and often inaccurate. Therefore, proxy measurements are mostly used: the better an application performs, the less energy is required.

The combination of the performance of the code and the energy consumption of the hardware then results in the CO2 footprint, for example.
