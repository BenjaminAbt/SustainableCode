### More performance with lower energy and memory consumption thanks to object pooling

This example impressively shows how performance can be massively increased thanks to the object pooling pattern built into .NET - and how energy consumption and memory allocations can be reduced in the process.

In percentage terms, significant performance increases and thus energy optimizations can be achieved with little effort in many applications, especially for string operations.
For this reason, the String Builder is used to illustrate the potentials.
