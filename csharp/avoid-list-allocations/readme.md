# üå≥ Sustainable Code - Avoid List Allocations üìä

Often you see class defintions that always and with every creation a list is initialized by default, although its actual use is not clear, e.g. with APIs, databases, models...

```csharp
public class DefaultListClass
{
    public List<string> MyList { get; set; } = new List<string>();
}
```

The problem here is that in the background of a list always an array is allocated, by default with 4 entries. If these entries are not enough then the list takes care of it internally and copies the array back and forth so that new entries can be added. This is an expensive runtime operation.
The same effect happens when lists are created but not actually used. Therefore this process can be optimized with great effects on performance and thus energy consumption.

## üèÅ Results

The results are very descriptive and very clear

- An implementation with the default behavior of List (4 entries) requires by far the most time, performance, memory
- The additional parameter for specifying the number of entries optimizes the performance
- However, the simplification in which the list is only created on demand is by far the best, fastest (~ -70%) and most efficient (~ -67%) solution in all aspects
- With .NET 8, the performance has further improved significantly for the Default, while the allocation remains unchanged

Optimizing list generation is not only incredibly efficient, but thanks to C#'s syntax sugar, it can be implemented without effort.
Therefore, there is no reason not to use this.
