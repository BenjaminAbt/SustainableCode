# üå≥ Sustainable Code - Struct vs Class with Boxing üìä

This small example should show how struct and class behave in .NET at runtime, and why struct with interfaces are less efficient.

```



## üèÅ Results

- üöÄ structs have by far the best efficiency when declared as readonly and used without an interface.
- üîã as soon as an interface is involved, structs have no more advantages due to boxing

## Remarks

- In principle, this behavior is nothing new. Potential solutions are already being worked ([dotnet/csharplang - Proposal: Allow readonly ref structs to implement interfaces, but disallow boxing them #1479](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/discussions/1479)) on so that structs can be used boxing-free.
