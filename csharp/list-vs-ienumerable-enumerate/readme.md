# üå≥ Sustainable Code - Enumerate List vs. IEnumerable  üìä

This code example shows the different behavior of runs of IEnumerable and List. 

> This example has no claim to how lists are handled in the very very best case, but **how they are currently handled in everyday life**.

- [List - msdocs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.list-1?view=net-6.0&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5001507)
- [IEnumeranle - msdocs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/system.collections.generic.ienumerable-1?view=net-6.0&WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5001507)

## Background of this test:
There are always the discussions whether to use List or IEnumerable - especially for returns.
So you can find many repository examples in the net, which say that IEnumerable is always the best solution - although for example a materialization is already done.

Whats better
```csharp
// This
public IEnumerable<MyEntity> GetEntities() // return List as IEnumerable
    return _context.MyEntities.ToList();

// or 
public List<MyEntity> GetEntities()
    return _context.MyEntities.ToList(); // return List as List
```

```



## üèÅ Results

- If you iterate through IEnumerable it means that the enumerator must be passed through when looping. This costs time.
- In this example, ToList ensures that materialization takes place before the loop, which is why appropriate allocations are necessary, but the throughput becomes faster.
- By far the fastest way is to treat an already [materialized](https://docs.microsoft.com/dotnet/standard/linq/intermediate-materialization?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5001507) `List`.
- The slowest way is to treat a `List` as IEnumerable, so that the enumerator has to be run again.

## Remarks

- Treat a materialized `List` as a `List`
- The return of a `List` should therefore not be `IEnumerable` if possible
- A `ToList` on an already materialized list hiding behind `IEnumerable` creates unnecessary allocations.


> Don't forget: this is not about the best way of `IEnumerable` and `List` in general, but how they are used in everyday life today and what impact this has. `IEnumerable` is good, has its legitimacy and advantages!
