# üå≥ Sustainable Code - Source Generator based Logging Messages üìä

This sample, based on .NET and [Compile-time logging source generation]](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5001507), shows how to write logs faster and with less to zero allocations.

## üî• Benchmark

For better comparability, additional string concat were added.

## üèÅ Results

- üéø The Generator is about 50-60% faster in creating the log messages, as expected.
- üîã The String Generator does not generate any allocations for shorter strings
- ‚ú® The benefits are comparable to general zero-allocation string generation.
- üï≥Ô∏è This benchmark is very simple. It may be different with real world exceptions and/or more parameters.
- Performance in .NET 8 has changed slightly, allocations have remained the same.

## Docs

- [Compile-time logging source generation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/extensions/logger-message-generator?WT.mc_id=DT-MVP-5001507)
- [Improving logging performance with source generators](https://andrewlock.net/exploring-dotnet-6-part-8-improving-logging-performance-with-source-generators/) by Andrew Lock

## Remarks

- Logging is relatively expensive and should be used overall well placed
- Often it is also worth improving the logging strategy in general to get more performance.
- The Log Message generator improves string generation with less to zero allocations.
- The generation is a helper / wrapper around the ILogger.

## ‚å®Ô∏è Run this sample

```shell
dotnet run -c Release
```

## Updates

- 2023/11 - Add .NET 8
