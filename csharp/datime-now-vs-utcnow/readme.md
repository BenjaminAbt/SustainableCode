# üå≥ Sustainable Code - DateTimeOffset vs. DateTime  üìä

Difference of DateTimeOffset vs. DateTime

The big lack of `DateTime`, which was also recognized early in .NET 1.0, is that it is not clear from the DateTime information which time zone the time information represents. Therefore `DateTime` is also called `implicit representation of time information`, whose "hope" is that the time information is always in relation to UTC-0. `DateTime` cannot guarantee this, which is why errors often occur in combination with time zones and `DateTime`.

Since the problems of `DateTime` were recognized early, there was a much better alternative in the form of `DateTimeOffset`, which has been the recommended variant since .NET 1.1. Probably because `DateTime` appears in IntelliSense earlier than `DateTimeOffset`, this is often used despite the massive deficits and the large error potential of `DateTime`.

```

## üèÅ Results

- üöÄ `UtcNow` is way faster than `Now`, because no timezone allignment is necessary
- üöÄ `DateTimeOffset` is faster than `DateTime`

## Remarks

- In an application, time information should always be treated as time zone neutral (i.e. UTC).
- The adjustment to the time zone should be done during the visualization of the time information (e.g. in the UI).
- The explicit way should always be preferred to an implicit one: therefore in .NET - whenever possible - `DateTimeOffset` should be used.
